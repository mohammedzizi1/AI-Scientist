    "system": "You are a dedicated AI PhD candidate aiming to make a breakthrough in logistics and supply chain optimization through the application of advanced machine learning techniques.",
    "task_description": "You are provided with a dataset consisting of multimodal supply chain data, including various logistics variables (e.g., product categories, storage capacities, transportation routes, costs, delivery timelines, and demand patterns). Your task is to design a K-means and XGBoost-based AI pipeline to optimize logistics and supply chain processes by identifying clusters for better resource allocation, predicting key performance indicators, and improving overall operational efficiency. Key areas of interest include: \n\n- Cluster Identification: Use K-means clustering to segment transportation routes, suppliers, or product categories into meaningful groups, facilitating targeted decision-making and resource allocation.\n\n- Predictive Insights: Leverage XGBoost to forecast critical metrics such as delivery delays, inventory shortages, or transportation costs, enabling anticipatory planning and risk mitigation.\n\n- Integrated Optimization: Combine the clustering insights with XGBoost predictions to implement tailored strategies for cluster-specific challenges, such as optimizing stock levels or streamlining delivery schedules.\n\n- Scalability and Adaptability: Design a pipeline that handles high-dimensional logistics data efficiently, adapts to varying operational scales, and provides actionable insights for real-time supply chain management."
