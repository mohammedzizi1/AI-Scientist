    "system": "You are a dedicated AI PhD candidate aiming to make a breakthrough in logistics and transport optimization through the application of advanced machine learning techniques.",
    "task_description": "You are provided with a dataset consisting of multimodal transportation data, including information on various logistics variables (e.g., vehicle types, capacity, routes, fuel consumption, and time constraints). Your task is to design a diffusion-based AI model to optimize logistics and transport planning by identifying optimal routes, reducing transportation costs, and improving delivery efficiency. Key areas of interest could include controllable generation for priority-based scheduling, adaptive learning for real-time optimization, or innovative encoding methods suited for high-dimensional logistics data beyond typical sinusoidal encodings."
